# Python Homework – Practice

Solve at least **one** question (recommended to try more) using **Python code**

## Question 1 – Sound system (match-case)

In a sound system there are volume levels from **1–10**

* 1 – very quiet
* 2 – quiet
* 3 – low
* 4 – low
* 5 – medium
* 6 – medium high
* 7 – loud
* 8 – very loud
* 9 and 10 – max volume

Tasks

* Input an integer from the user (1–10)
* Use `match case` to display the correct sound description
* If the number is not between 1–10 print `invalid volume`

## Question 2 – Countdown with time.sleep

Use the `time.sleep` function to create the following output

* Print 5
* Sleep 1 second
* Print 4
* Sleep 1 second
* Print 3
* Sleep 1 second
* Print 2
* Sleep 1 second
* Print 1
* Sleep 1 second
* Print `0 - Launch`

Rules

* Use `import time`
* Use `time.sleep(1)` between prints

## Question 3 – Restaurant recommendation (booleans)

Input from the user

* The time it took the restaurant to bring the meal (in minutes)
* The price of the meal (in shekels)

Create boolean variables

* `is_quick_service` – True if the time is **less than 15 minutes**, otherwise False
* `is_expensive` – True if the price is **more than 100 shekels**, otherwise False

Now check

* If `is_quick_service` and **not** `is_expensive` print `recommended`
* Otherwise print `not recommended`

## Question 4 – Post office delivery (f-string)

For a post office delivery, input the following details from the user:

* last name
* first name
* country
* city address
* zipcode

### Fixes & Requirements

* The **last name** string should be **uppercase**  
** Use a **while loop** and `isupper` to validate the last name input  
* The **first name** string should be **lowercase**  
** Use a **while loop** and `islower` to validate the first name input  
* The **country** string length must be **at most 3 letters** (for example: US, IL)  
** Use a **while loop** and `isalpha` `len` to validate the country input  
* The **zipcode** must contain **digits only** and be at least 4 letters  
** Use a **while loop** and `isdigit` `len` to validate the zipcode input  

### Output Format

FOR: LASTNAME, firstname  
COUNTRY: IL  
ADDRESS: Tel Aviv  
ZIPCODE: 12345  

Use `print(f"...")`

FOR: {last-name}, {first-name}  
COUNTRY: {country}  
ADDRESS: {city address}  
ZIPCODE: {zipcode}
